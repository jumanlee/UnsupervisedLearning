# My chosen project (abstract): 

The main aim of this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of two similar clustering algorithms - K-means clustering and hierachical clustering, in order to identify high-risk diabetic patients. The aim is to examine how accurately these algorithms are able to segment patient data into meaningful clusters that differentiate patients based on their risk levels.

For this project, the diabetes dataset from the scikit-learn library is used and dimentionality-reduced using the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) algorithm. This dataset comprises various medical attributes of dibetic patients. The study aims to apply both clustering algorithms independently. Each algorithm's ability to separate out high-risk patient gorups will be compared.

# Requirements prescribed:

## Aim
You must decide what you wish to achieve. Possibilities include: the best ML model for a
particular dataset; comparison of algorithms across differing datasets; systematic examination of
variations of a particular algorithm (for example, naive k-means vs PCA initialisation); comparison
of different algorithms on a dataset or datasets (for example, k-means vs other clustering
algorithms).

## Choosing a dataset/datasets
You can either choose a dataset/datasets that is/are packaged with a machine learning library or
pick a dataset that interests you from a public repository such as kaggle.com.
For example, scikit-learn contains several standard, classic datasets such as Iris, Wine and Handwritten digits. These are perfect for this project.
You might wish to browse (e.g.) kaggle for an interesting dataset but please ensure that you can
vectorise the dataset into a suitable form for input into a machine learning algorithm. You will not
receive any credit for manipulating the data prior to analysis.

## Algorithms
You should apply at least two machine learning algorithms from the first part of this module to
your chosen problem. Specifically, at least two from: kNN, decision trees, linear regression,
gradient descent, polynomial regression, Bayesian classification, k-means and PCA.
You should implement at least one of the ML algorithms from scratch. This/these
implementation(s) must be in standard Python code and should not refer to any machine learning
libraries. The use of numpy and matplotlib is permissible (and expected).

## Methodology, Analysis and Evaluation
The first half of this module (Topics 1-6) introduced several important ML techniques such as
Training/test set splitting, classifier evaluation metrics (precision, accuracy, â€¦), data scaling, over/
under fitting, regularisation and cross-validation. You should utilise these techniques wherever
appropriate.
